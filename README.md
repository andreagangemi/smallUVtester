An Arduino project to measure UV - The goal is to measure how much sunglasses can filter UV

This is a simple Arduino based project to read analog value from a GUVA-S12SD UV sensor.

It is not about measuring the UV index, rather I want to make comparison between readings to check how much UV are filtered from sunglasses and other materials.

Thanks to Adriano Gandolfo, I used his site www.adrirobot.it to kickstart the project.
